Custom version of craftus that intends to clone minecraft 1.16.5

Releases won't be happening for a while so you'll need devkitpro installed to compile this (and ofc, a hacked system that can load homebrew, citra also seems to work well)

Craftus Redisigned is a modified version of Craftus Reloaded : https://github.com/RSDuck/craftus_reloaded.

After launching it for the first time, you can change the controls in `sd:/craftus_redesigned/options.ini`.
You can also change the settings in `sd:/craftus_redesigned/options.ini`.

test fall damage

make world spawn better so it works on noise generated worlds (currently just sets you to 0,17,0 on death)

add gui stuff for gamerules

add difficulty

multiplayer (either local, use a external server or p2p)

custom skins

mobs

sound and music

fire

sort textures into a more minecraft way (resource and data packs?)

lighting

make doors actually work

any help would be appreciated here

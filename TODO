make fall damage use a actual formula instead of just checking for velocity

add gui stuff for gamerules

difficulty (speedrunning hardcore would be fun on this)

multiplayer (either local, use a external server or p2p, would most likely need a entire rewrite of the player system)

custom skins

mobs

sound and music

fire

sort textures into a more minecraft way (resource and data packs?)

lighting

make doors actually work

gates and fences

hunger

hud stuff for hp

day night cycle

weather

stats like how many kills, time survived and player deaths

tnt

dimensions

furnace

ores

potions

projectiles

liquids

block hardness and explosion resistance

redstone

add beds (bed bombs?)
